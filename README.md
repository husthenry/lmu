# lmu
lua + mongoose + unqlite

Lmu makes it possible to create a websocket-based webapp by lua language. Lmu is designed for embedded linux, but it can also be built and run under other platforms, like win32. Lmu supports unqlite, an embedded NoSQL database, so it can create a normal webapp that support storage.
